# C1ZZL3 Gnarly

C1ZZL3 Gnarly is a dual-oscillator phase-distortion synth card for the Music
Thing Modular Workshop Computer.

Gnarly is the most complex C1ZZL3 branch. It keeps the Web MIDI sound-preset
workflow from the advanced C1ZZL3 experiments, but removes the Turing machine
panel mode so the hardware controls can focus on oscillator editing, recipe wave
banks, ring modulation, and noise/grit.

For the user-facing card guide, see:

```

## Status

This folder contains the stable Gnarly card 101 build.

```text
release: 101 / Gnarly protocol v11 stable
draft: false
```

Core C1ZZL3 remains card 84. Rad can be added to card 84 in due course as an
additional version. Gnarly is prepared here as a separate card identity because
its hardware behaviour is substantially different.

## What It Does

- Runs two phase-distortion oscillator lanes.
- Uses separate Amp1/Amp2, PD1/PD2, and Pitch1/Pitch2 envelopes.
- Supports named sound presets saved on the card.
- Saves either envelope-only data or full sound presets with performance
  settings.
- Uses four recipe wave banks for simple and CZ-like oscillator pairings.
- Reads and writes settings through the Gnarly Web MIDI Lab.
- Imports Casio CZ `.syx` patches through the shared C1ZZL3 Import Lab.
- Removes Turing CV, Turing pulse, and generated Turing MIDI behaviour.

## Hardware Controls

Switch middle: oscillator 1 page.

- Main: shared pitch
- X: oscillator 1 phase distortion
- Y: oscillator 1 recipe slot in the selected bank

Switch up: oscillator 2 page.

- Main: oscillator 2 base interval/spread, centred at unison
- X: oscillator 2 phase distortion
- Y: oscillator 2 recipe slot in the selected bank

Switch down hold: performance and bank page.

- Main: recipe bank
- X: ring modulation
- Y: noise/grit

## Recipe Banks

- Bank 1: simple single-wave families.
- Bank 2: warmer compound pairings with double-sine support.
- Bank 3: brighter resonant/windowed pairings.
- Bank 4: odd/import-faithful CZ-style pairings for translated patches.

Each oscillator recipe slot chooses one entry from the current bank. In Bank 1
the slots are the eight plain C1ZZL3 wave families. In Banks 2 to 4 the slots
become fixed compound recipes:

- Bank 1:
  Slot 1 `Saw`
  Slot 2 `Square`
  Slot 3 `Narrow pulse`
  Slot 4 `Double sine`
  Slot 5 `Saw pulse`
  Slot 6 `Resonant saw window`
  Slot 7 `Resonant triangle window`
  Slot 8 `Resonant trapezoid window`
- Bank 2:
  Slot 1 `Double sine + Saw`
  Slot 2 `Double sine + Square`
  Slot 3 `Saw + Double sine`
  Slot 4 `Square + Double sine`
  Slot 5 `Narrow pulse + Double sine`
  Slot 6 `Saw pulse + Double sine`
  Slot 7 `Resonant triangle window + Double sine`
  Slot 8 `Resonant trapezoid window + Double sine`
- Bank 3:
  Slot 1 `Resonant saw window + Saw`
  Slot 2 `Resonant triangle window + Square`
  Slot 3 `Resonant trapezoid window + Narrow pulse`
  Slot 4 `Resonant saw window + Saw pulse`
  Slot 5 `Resonant triangle window + Saw pulse`
  Slot 6 `Resonant trapezoid window + Saw pulse`
  Slot 7 `Resonant saw window + Narrow pulse`
  Slot 8 `Resonant trapezoid window + Square`
- Bank 4:
  Slot 1 `Saw pulse + Double sine`
  Slot 2 `Resonant triangle window + Double sine`
  Slot 3 `Saw pulse + Narrow pulse`
  Slot 4 `Resonant trapezoid window + Double sine`
  Slot 5 `Resonant saw window + Saw pulse`
  Slot 6 `Narrow pulse + Resonant trapezoid window`
  Slot 7 `Square + Resonant saw window`
  Slot 8 `Resonant triangle window + Narrow pulse`

These are not equal 50/50 blends. Each recipe leans toward its first waveform,
with the second waveform mixed in at a fixed amount chosen in the firmware.
That is why some pairings feel like a coloured version of one family rather
than a completely even hybrid.

On the switch-down page, LEDs 1 and 2 show the selected recipe bank:

- Bank 1: LEDs 1 and 2 off.
- Bank 2: LED 1 on.
- Bank 3: LED 2 on.
- Bank 4: LEDs 1 and 2 on.

## MIDI

Gnarly uses `CC20` to `CC27` as an eight-knob performance block. `CC1` is also
kept as oscillator 1 phase distortion so a mod wheel remains useful.

- `CC1`: oscillator 1 phase distortion, mod-wheel friendly.
- `CC20`: oscillator 1 recipe slot.
- `CC21`: oscillator 2 recipe slot.
- `CC22`: ring modulation amount.
- `CC23`: recipe bank.
- `CC24`: oscillator 2 interval/spread.
- `CC25`: oscillator 2 phase distortion.
- `CC26`: noise/grit amount.
- `CC27`: oscillator 1 phase distortion, for eight-knob controllers.

The C1ZZL3 Envelope Lab has a hidden Developer-mode MIDI CC Test Suite for checking these messages without a hardware controller. It sends individual CC values, a neutral reset, and sweep tests through the selected Web MIDI output.

## Web MIDI Editor

Hosted editor path after Workshop deployment:

```text
https://tomwhitwell.github.io/Workshop_Computer/programs/101-gnarly-c1zzl3/web/index.html
```

Local editor from this release folder:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 5177 --directory web
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5177
```

Use Chrome or another browser with Web MIDI and SysEx support. When Web MIDI connects, the editor automatically checks card settings and saved envelope slots so the detected firmware type is shown without requiring a manual read first.

## C1ZZL3 Import Lab

Hosted import lab path after Workshop deployment:

```text
https://tomwhitwell.github.io/Workshop_Computer/programs/101-gnarly-c1zzl3/web/import/index.html
```

Local import lab from this release folder:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 5178 --directory web/import
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5178
```

Use this page to decode Casio CZ `.syx` patches into C1ZZL3 drafts with separate
oscillator envelopes, pitch lanes, oscillator wave choices, performance values,
and recipe-bank-compatible settings.

## Build

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DPICO_NO_PICOTOOL=1
cmake --build build -j2
```

The build creates:
