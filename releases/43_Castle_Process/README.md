# Castle Process

Fort Processor-inspired harsh noise processor for the Music Thing Modular Workshop Computer.

Castle Process is a performance card built around chopped external audio, crude internal squarewave energy, aggressive switching between sources, and a separate bass pulse layer.

It is designed as a playable sound-destruction tool rather than a clean effect or faithful clone.

# What It Does

Castle Process combines:

* distorted and chopped external audio
* crude internal squarewave texture
* variable switching between internal and external material
* a dedicated bass pulse voice

The outputs are split by role:

* `Audio 1` carries most of the chopped external input character
* `Audio 2` carries the bass voice with supporting texture

# Controls

## Main Knob

Controls overall drive and voicing.

## X Knob

Controls chopping behaviour and motion.

## Y Knob

Controls tuning and internal interaction.

## Switch Middle

Default mode.

This is the tighter and more direct chopped mode.

## Switch Up

Alternate latched mode.

This lets a little more body through and adds more squarewave colour.

## Switch Down

Momentary bend / chaos gesture while held.

This is intended as a live performance action.

# Inputs

## Audio In 1

Main external audio input.

The signal is meant to be broken up, gated, and forced into the processor rather than passed through cleanly.

## CV 1 / CV 2

Internal control modulation inputs.

## Pulse In 1

External bass trigger input.

When used, it takes over bass timing and suppresses the internal bass trigger behaviour.

## Pulse In 2

Reserved for further interaction.

---

# Outputs

## Audio 1

Primary chopped external-input output.

## Audio 2

Bass-focused output with supporting noise texture.

## Pulse Out 1

Bass activity pulse output.

## Pulse Out 2

Internal chop pulse output.

# Patch Ideas

* feed a drum loop, voice, or oscillator into `Audio In 1` for chopped destruction
* use `Audio 1` as the main harsh-noise output
* use `Audio 2` as the low companion layer
* trigger `Pulse In 1` from a sequencer or clock divider for controlled bass rhythms
* use switch `Down` as a manual performance accent
