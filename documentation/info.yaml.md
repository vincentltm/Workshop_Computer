# `info.yaml` schema

Each program card under `releases/NN_name/` includes an `info.yaml` beside `README.md` and its `.uf2` firmware. Sitegen and `update-readme.py` read these files when building the GitHub Pages site and `releases/README.md`.

Keys are case-insensitive. Hyphens and spaces in key names are equivalent (`audio-sample`, `Audio Sample`, and `audiosample` all map to the same field).

## Minimal example

```yaml
draft: true
Name: Card Display Name
short-description: One-line catalog tagline
summary: Longer operator overview of what the card does and how it is used
Language: C++ (Pico SDK)
Creator: Your Name
Version: "1.0"
Status: Released
License: MIT
date-created: 2025-02-14
date-updated: 2026-06-21
```

## Core fields

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `draft` | no | boolean | When `true`, structured metadata in this file is still under author review. Set to `false` when `Name`, `contact`, `License`, `panel`, and related fields are confirmed. Not rendered on detail pages yet; parsed for tooling and future site UI. |
| `Name` | yes | string | Display title on the site index and detail page (see sitegen). |
| `short-description` | yes | string | Concise catalog tagline shown on index tiles, discovery shelves, and archive rows. |
| `summary` | yes | string | Longer operator overview shown beneath the title on the card detail page. Inline Markdown is supported, including links, emphasis, and code. |
| `Language` | yes | string | Implementation language or stack (e.g. `C++ (Pico SDK)`, `Lua / Blackbird`). |
| `Creator` | yes | string | Author or maintainer name. |
| `Version` | yes | string | Semantic or project version string. |
| `Status` | yes | string | Release state (e.g. `Released`, `Beta`, `WIP`). Shown with version on the index. |
| `License` | no | string | Recommended. SPDX identifier or short license name (e.g. `MIT`, `GPL-3.0`, `GPLv3 or later`). Use the license stated in the card's `README.md` or `LICENSE` file. A missing license produces a warning when `draft: false`. |
| `date-created` | no | string | Original publication or creation date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). |
| `date-updated` | no | string | Date of the most recent substantial release update (`YYYY-MM-DD`). |

`date-created` and `date-updated` are independently optional. Authors should omit either date when it is unknown rather than estimate it.

Text fields should be quoted when a value could otherwise be interpreted by YAML as a boolean. Numeric YAML scalars remain accepted for compatibility with historical unquoted `Version` values, but new metadata should quote version strings as shown above.

## Contact

Optional creator/maintainer contact details. Not rendered on detail pages yet; parsed for tooling and future site UI.

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `contact.email` | no | string | Contact email address. |
| `contact.website` | no | string (URL) | Personal or project website. |
| `contact.social` | no | object | Map of platform name → profile URL (keys normalized to lowercase, no spaces). |

```yaml
contact:
  email: you@example.com
  website: https://example.com
  social:
    instagram: https://instagram.com/username
    github: https://github.com/username
    mastodon: https://mastodon.social/@username
```

## Web editor

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `Editor` | no | string | Controls the **Web Editor** button and static deploy. See values below. |
| `web-entry` | no | string | Entry HTML file when not `index.html` (e.g. `app.html`). |

### `Editor` values

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| *(omitted)* | If `web/` exists in the card folder, sitegen copies it to GitHub Pages and links `programs/<slug>/web/index.html`. |
| `web` or `dist` | Copy that folder to Pages (relative to the card directory). |
| `https://…` | External editor URL; no local copy. |
| `none` | Hide the Web Editor button. |

## Discovery and linking

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `repository` | no | string (URL) | Upstream source repo when firmware or docs live outside this monorepo. Example: [64_voices_of_sid](https://github.com/TomWhitwell/Workshop_Computer/blob/main/releases/64_voices_of_sid/info.yaml) points at Codeberg. |
| `discussion` | no | string (URL) | Card-specific feedback or support destination, normally a Discord thread. This replaces the site's general discussion link on that card's detail page. |
| `tags` | no | string[] | Labels for card type and function. Use lowercase kebab-case (e.g. `sequencer`, `midi-host`, `effect`, `synthesizer`, `polyphonic`, `utility`). Sitegen normalizes and deduplicates. A single comma-separated string is also accepted. |

```yaml
discussion: https://discord.com/channels/SERVER_ID/CHANNEL_OR_THREAD_ID
```

## Firmware downloads

By default the site auto-discovers download links from every committed (git-tracked) `.uf2` under the card folder, excluding a `web/` copy when an identically-named file exists elsewhere. Each link is labelled with the firmware filename.

Add an optional `uf2:` list to curate this. **When `uf2:` is present it fully replaces auto-discovery for that card**, so you can trim noise, control ordering, and annotate firmware. Each entry needs **either** a `path` (repo firmware) **or** a `download.url` (external link):

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `path` | either path or download | string | Path to the `.uf2` relative to the card folder (e.g. `UF2/goldfish.2.0.2mb.uf2`), matched case-insensitively. The build errors if the file is missing. |
| `name` | no | string | Friendly label shown on the download tile instead of the filename. |
| `download` | either path or download | object | `{ url, sha256, flashable? }` (`url` and `sha256` are required). `url` is an external mirror, direct firmware URL, or store/purchase page. It opens in a new tab, shows its host, and is tagged "External". Set `flashable: true` only for a direct UF2 URL whose host permits cross-origin browser requests (CORS); the site verifies `sha256` before erasing or writing the connected card. `sha256` is the firmware's hex digest (`shasum -a 256 file.uf2` on macOS). For repo-hosted firmware (via `path`) the build computes it automatically. |

Do not add `sha256` beside a repository-hosted `path`; the build calculates that hash from the tracked file. Validation accepts it only to provide a warning that it is unnecessary.

```yaml
uf2:
  - path: UF2/goldfish.2.0.2mb.uf2
    name: Goldfish 2.0 (2MB)
  - name: Buy a pre-flashed card
    download:
      url: https://example.com/store/goldfish
      sha256: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
  - name: External firmware mirror
    download:
      url: https://downloads.example.com/goldfish.uf2
      sha256: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
      flashable: true
```

## Media

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `demo-link` | no | string (URL) | Optional YouTube URL (`watch`, `youtu.be`, `/shorts/`, `/embed/`). Rendered as a demo-video thumbnail on the detail page that plays inline when clicked. README YouTube links also get inline embeds. |
| `audio-sample` | no | string or list | Demo audio. Accepts a single value or a list. Each value may be: a **repo-relative file** (e.g. `samples/demo.wav`, resolved to a raw URL and rendered with an `<audio>` player); a **SoundCloud** track/set URL (embedded as a player, derived from the URL — no API key); a **Bandcamp** *EmbeddedPlayer* URL (the iframe `src` from Bandcamp's Share → Embed dialog); or any other URL (shown as a link). You may also paste a whole embed `<iframe>` snippet (we extract the player `src` + height), but you must single-quote it in YAML. List items may also be `{ url, title }` objects (`title` shows above the player). |
```yaml
# single file
audio-sample: samples/demo.wav

# or a list mixing sources. For SoundCloud/Bandcamp, paste the player src URL:
audio-sample:
  - samples/demo.wav
  - https://soundcloud.com/artist/my-demo
  - https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=123456789/size=large/

# with titles:
audio-sample:
  - url: https://soundcloud.com/artist/patch-1
    title: Patch 1 — generative drone
```

> Bandcamp: use the `EmbeddedPlayer` URL — it is the `src` of the iframe in Bandcamp's **Share → Embed** dialog. A plain album or track page URL cannot be embedded on its own and will render as a link.

## Structured metadata

These blocks document the primary inline documentation, I/O, controls, and host connectivity. Panel metadata is rendered on program detail pages. Unconditioned entries form the shared base; entries conditioned with `when.z` override that base for the selected switch position.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `readme` | string (Markdown) | Full inline operator documentation. When present, it replaces the rendered `README.md` section on the card detail page. It is Markdown content, not a path. Supplementary PDF documentation remains visible. |
| `panel.inputs` | object[] | Panel jacks in. Each item has `id`, `name`, optional `description`, optional `type` (`audio` / `cv` / `pulse` / `other`), and optional `when.z` or `when.panel` context. Entries with the same `id` override the shared entry in that view. |
| `panel.outputs` | object[] | Panel jacks out; same shape and position-override behavior as inputs. |
| `controls.knobs` | object[] | Knob metadata rows containing `main` / `x` / `y` entries with `name` and optional `description`. Omit `when` for shared controls; use `when.z` for generated positions or `when.panel` for custom manifest IDs. |
| `controls.switch` | object | Switch metadata keyed by optional `up`, `middle`, `down`, and `tap` entries. The three physical positions may produce panel views. `tap` describes a brief Down-switch action, never produces a panel view, and may be authored without `down`. |
| `controls.leds` | object[] | LED meaning rows. Each has optional `when.z` or `when.panel`, `display` (e.g. `list`), and `items` with `id`, `name`, and optional `description`. Items override shared LEDs by `id`. |
| `host` | object | Host/USB connectivity (e.g. `usb` list with `name`, `role`, `description`) and optional `notes` (Markdown). |

```yaml
readme: |
  # Operating instructions

  Patch an audio signal to **Audio In 1**, then use Main to set the amount.
```

`readme` replaces the former `manual` field. Existing authored `manual` content should be migrated to `readme`; `summary` remains the operator overview shown in the card detail header.

See [`releases/82_Computer_Grids/info.yaml`](../releases/82_Computer_Grids/info.yaml) for a full structured example.

### Switch and knobs relationship

Switch-position meaning and panel metadata are related but remain independently authored:

- **`controls.switch`** documents any relevant Z positions and may independently document a Down-switch `tap` action; `tap` does not require a `down` entry.
- Unconditioned knobs, sockets, and LEDs are the base inherited by Up, Middle, and Down.
- A `when: { z: ... }` row supplies only the properties that change in that position.
- Down already means the switch is being held down. There is no separate Hold position or gesture condition.
- Tap never changes knob, socket, or LED meanings, so `tap` is invalid in a `when` clause.

```yaml
controls:
  switch:                     # what the switch positions mean
    up:     { name: Double Length, description: Toggle write cell each clock for a stable double-length loop }
    middle: { name: Unlock,        description: Write from data input / noise when data exceeds Chaos }
    down:   { name: Write,         description: Hold down to force the write cell to a fixed value }
    tap:    { name: Reset,         description: Briefly press and release Down to reset the sequence }
  knobs:
    -                            # no condition: applies in every position
      main: { name: Chaos, description: Lock through Chaos probability }
      x:    { name: Offset }
      y:    { name: Chaos VCA }
    - when: { z: up }           # optional: a knob whose role changes in this position
      x: { name: Loop Length, description: Sets the loop length while held up }
```

A card that only needs to describe its switch uses `controls.switch` alone. A card whose automatically generated panel changes by position adds conditioned knob, socket, or LED rows. Sitegen resolves at most three generated views as `base + up`, `base + middle`, and `base + down`; Middle is the default when present.

Legacy `when: { z: any }` rows are still read as shared base metadata but should be written without `when`. Legacy `gesture` conditions produce validation warnings while existing cards are reviewed.

### Custom panel presentations

Complex cards may provide a lowercase `panels/` directory beside `info.yaml`. A `panels/manifest.yaml` file activates the custom presentation override: the site does not publish the automatically generated Up/Middle/Down panels when a manifest exists, even when that manifest is invalid or incomplete. A `panels/` directory without a manifest is treated as an ordinary asset directory and does not activate custom panels. Structured controls, sockets, LEDs, and switch metadata remain available as machine-readable card data.

`panels/manifest.yaml` defines any number of ordered, arbitrarily named presentations:

```yaml
version: 1
default: performance

panels:
  - id: overview
    name: Overview
    image: overview.svg
    content: overview.md
  - id: performance
    name: Performance Mode
    image: performance.svg
    content: performance.md
  - id: slice-editor
    name: Slice Editor
    image: slice-editor.svg
    content: slice-editor.md
```

- `id` is a stable, unique lowercase kebab-case identifier used by `when.panel` and direct panel links.
- `name` is arbitrary display text and may be changed without changing the ID.
- `image` and `content` are safe paths relative to `panels/`; absolute paths, traversal, and symbolic links are rejected.
- `default` must name a valid panel ID. Manifest order is display order.
- Every image must be a self-contained SVG with `viewBox="0 0 560 1785"`. Generated/downloaded SVGs use the documentation-default intrinsic viewport of `width="280"` and `height="892.5"`. Scripts, `foreignObject`, event handlers, and external resources are rejected.
- Every presentation requires companion Markdown. It is rendered beside the image instead of the generated controls/I/O/LED reference, and provides the accessible textual explanation of text embedded in the image.
- Relative images and links in the Markdown resolve inside `panels/`.

Physical component IDs do not change. Use `main`, `x`, `y`, ComputerCard jack IDs, and LED IDs as usual; use a manifest panel ID only as the condition:

```yaml
controls:
  knobs:
    - main: { name: Level }       # shared by every custom panel
    - when: { panel: performance }
      x: { name: Density }
      y: { name: Spread }
    - when: { panel: slice-editor }
      x: { name: Slice Start }
      y: { name: Slice Length }
```

Sockets and LED rows support the same `when.panel` condition. Unconditioned rows form the shared base and matching rows override it. A condition must use either `when.z` or `when.panel`, never both. `when.panel` requires a custom manifest and must exactly match one of its IDs.

The Author page and standalone panel-design skill use the shared browser-side vector renderer and produce self-contained SVGs with the canonical 560 × 1785 viewBox. Run `npm run setup-panel-renderer` once when the skill reports that its pinned headless Chromium runtime or Linux dependencies are missing. Add the approved SVG and companion Markdown to `panels/`, then reference them from the manifest.

## Authoring guidance

When filling in structured metadata for a release folder:

**Source priority (do not invent behavior):**

1. `README.md` in the release folder (operator intent)
2. In-repo source (`.cpp`, `.c`, `.lua`, etc.) — ground truth for jack wiring when README is thin or wrong
3. External repo linked from `Repository` or README
4. Music Thing program card pages (for legacy cards with minimal local README)

**`id` vs `name`:**

- **`id`** — exact ComputerCard API identifier (`PulseIn1`, `CVOut1`, `AudioIn1`, …). See `Demonstrations+HelloWorlds/PicoSDK/ComputerCard/ComputerCard.h`.
- **`name`** — functional role on this card (e.g. `External Clock`, not `Pulse In 1`; `Beat Tick`, not `LED 0`).
- **`description`** — longer behavior note; may reference the API id in prose.

Only list jacks the firmware actually uses. Repurposed jacks (e.g. CV on `AudioOut1`) still use the real API id.

**Placeholder folders** (`77_Placeholder`, `88_Blank`, `02_comingsoon`): core fields only — do not fabricate `panel` / `controls`.

**Low certainty:** when a block is inferred from code but not stated in README, add a YAML comment above it:

```yaml
# certainty: low — knob roles inferred from main.cpp; not documented in README
controls:
  knobs: ...
```

**Preserve** existing `short-description`, `summary`, `Language`, `Creator`, `Version`, `Status`, `License`, `Editor`, and `Repository` values unless deployment rules require a change.

Every card must include **`Name`** — the site index and detail page title come from this field. Legacy `Title` is still read as a fallback if `Name` is absent.

## Automation

- **`pages.yml`** — runs `tools/sitegen`, deploys `site/` (including copied `web/` folders).
- **`update-readme.yml`** — regenerates `releases/README.md` from each card’s `info.yaml`.

**Future:** per-card `npm` builds in CI before copying `dist/` to Pages; commit built assets and set `Editor: dist` (or whatever your output folder is) until then.
